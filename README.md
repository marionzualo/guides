# Guides
This is a high level description of some of the guidelines I try to follow and which in my opinion lead to better code (i.e. code that is easy to maintain and change).

Keep in mind:
- These are guidelines not rules.
- I violate these guidelines when I have a good reason to do so (i.e context matters).
- I follow these guidelines on my personal projects. If I am working on a team, I’ll apply the guidelines which are inline with the team’s culture.

The main goals of this repository are:
- document the guidelines I believe to be appropriate - so I can come back here from time to time in order to recall them.

- document the links/books/videos that have helped me write those guidelines -  so I can share some of the great content that lead me to write those guidelines. I think these resources can be helpful for beginners starting out, or for experts trying to learn more about a certain topic.

This is a process I follow when learning about a certain topic and I figured it could be helpful to others as well.

This repository is organised in terms of folders, each folder will have guidelines around a certain topic.

Currently, I am working with Rails so, most of the guides will focus around the Rails ecosystem. I will usually have guidelines for things I am reasonably experienced about. For things in which I am just a beginner I will mostly document what have been the most useful resources for me and why.

This is a work in progress.

A note on the language:
- ”Avoid" means don't do it unless you have good reason.
- ”Don't" means there's never a good reason.
- “Prefer" indicates a better option and its alternative to watch out for.
- “Use" is a positive instruction.

## Inspiration
I first started thinking about this idea when I read Sivers’ post on [compressing knowledge into directives](https://sivers.org/2do). The structure of this project is inspired by [Thoughtbot’s guides](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides).

## Contributing
These are the guidelines I like to keep in mind when developing software. I am more than welcome to receive suggestions on how to make these thoughts accessible to the community at large, or discuss them in case you have questions. Yet I don’t plan to turn this into the "community guidelines" so, I don’t plan to make any changes to which I don’t agree to.

You are more than welcome to fork this and do whatever you want with the content. Everything I learned, I learned it from somebody else. I am more than happy to pay it forward.
